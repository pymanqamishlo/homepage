        <p>Dreams are just like flowers,we can't imagine our life without and as such we have to take care of just as we do with flowers to grow up as we want. Every one in this life has his own dreams and lam that one who has alot of dreams and l would like all my dreams to come true one day. One of my dreams is to take a trip around the world, so that l would be able to get knowledge and insight about that an unknown world for me. I know that is impossible to happen but l belive in God's power that can be able to turn the impossible to sth possible. For that l keep on praying him to make it true.I dream of a world made up of good people which includes their choices, their passions, their likes & all the good things that they desire. In fact we cannot live in such a world which exists in my dream but I think in dreams we can make anything happen.
My dream is big, wide and far away from this real world. My dream world has no place for violence and hatred. We all are seeing a lot of bad things in the televisions and newspapers that is happening in various parts of this world today.
The reality of this world where I am living right now makes me afraid to live here because I can see negativity and sins all around me. I dream of a world which has no greed, hatred and violence but it is full of love, peace & harmony.</p>
